# What you'll build 📋
### In addition to your lab, you'll implement the following features:
#### Home screen:

- Each row will display the avatar, name, and email of the user
- Cache images

#### Profile screen:
- Choose an app and try to mimic its profile screen
- Will display the information of the user
